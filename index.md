## Smartcar 2.0 (In development)

1) The 'Modules' board - Significant revision from v1 that you see above. See below for concept layouts & BOM

![Optional compute concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosmo-robot/smartcar_shield/master/extras/images/modules.png)

2) the 'Motor board - Largely unchanged mechanically from the V1 board you see above, additional motor driver to enable mecanum drive


![Dual driver concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosmo-robot/smartcar_shield/master/extras/images/motors.png)

Longer term

- Offering an alternate/upgraded BLDC motor board using SimpleFOC, but re-using the 'Modules' board
