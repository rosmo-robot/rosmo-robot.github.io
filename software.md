[Microblocks](#Microblocks).

[MicroPython](#MicroPython).

[ROS2](#ROS2).


Rosmo can be used in a few different applications:

* A **STEM learning platform using microblocks** for people just starting with robotics
  
* A robot for **Students and hobbyists to learn Python & ROS2 programming** with
  the same tools, languages, and libraries used in professional and industrial robots.

# Microblocks 

1) Download [ESP32-S3 bin](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/rosmo-robot.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/v1/vm_esp32_s3.bin)
   
3) Visit [ESP web tool in a Chrome browser](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/)
   
5) Connect ESP32-S3 and flash device (you may need to hold the 'boot' button)
   
7) Use the [Pilot version in Chrome](https://microblocks.fun/run-pilot/microblocks.html){:target="_blank"}
   
8) In Microblocks; Cog icon > Install ESP firmware from URL > Paste https://microblocks.fun/downloads/pilot/vm/vm_esp32-s3.bin
   
9) Download this raw [UBP file](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/rosmo-robot.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/v1/rosmo-wifiremote-public.ubp){:target="_blank"} and open it in the Microblocks app.

- Provides a block programing interface 

- Provides an [Android app](http://www.microblocks.fun/wifigamepad/gamepadwifiremote.apk){:target="_blank"}  for remote control & [detailed instructions](http://www.microblocks.fun/en/wifi/gamepad){:target="_blank"}

# ROS2 

Software; Best if you want to learn ROS2 based on [Linorobot2](https://github.com/hippo5329/linorobot2)

Status: Wheels spinning, encoders working but not fully tested yet.

<a name="MicroPython"></a>
## MicroPython 

Status: Beta released providing Webui to drive the robot with encoders 

Please see [Micropython repository](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/micropython)

Thanks to [Alex](https://github.com/UEA-envsoft) for contributing this code


##  Openbot (Android) software;  

Status: Needs tweaking for ESP32S3

- Android app and Arduino for computer vision & AI
- [https://www.openbot.org](https://www.openbot.org/research)

## C++/ Arduino software

Status: Doesn't exist yet, 
Might be interesting to do something with [Arduino Mecanum](https://github.com/StormingMoose/DroneBot-Workshop-Mecanum-for-L9110S) and maybe [Smartcar Shield](https://github.com/platisd/smartcar_shield?tab=readme-ov-file#software) at some point.  

##  Possible learning journey

-   Assemble 2WD bot
-   Drive 2WD bot with Microblocks remote control from Android 
-   try to make the robot drive in a straight line
-   Configure the encoders in microblocks and try again 
-   Add a pair of mechanical bump sensors, in microblocks do bump & run
-   Add a sharpie - Draw a straight line on a large piece of paper
-   Draw your initials
-   Add a pair of line sensors, follow a line 
-   Add 2x wheels to make a 4wd bot
-   Configure Microblocks to run 4WD
-   Try and make it go in a straight line again
-   Complete the [parking challenge](https://introtoroboticsv2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course/driving/parking.html) using microblocks
-   Add Mecanum wheels.
-   In Microblocks make the robot go sideways with remote control
-   Complete the parking challenge again without making the robot turn at all
-   Install an IMU & configure in Microblocks
-   Add a ESP32 cam and watch the livestream from a computer
-   Install a grabber & move an object from a to b in the parking challenge
-   Move two objects
-   Add a daughterboard with 2x oled
-   Load the robot eyes in microblocks & make the eyes interact with the controls
-   Install thonny/ micropython and complete steps 1-15 in Micropython code
-   Install ROS and complete steps 1-15 again
-   Install a Lidar and map a room
-   Run the robot. A lot.
-   Add the protoboard add on - Add a novel sensor to the bot and get it working
-   In easyeda create a daughterboard to your own design
