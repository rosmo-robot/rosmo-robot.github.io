Parts excluding PCB and motor driver are available on this [List](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/wishlist/shareReflux.html?groupId=H3r6Ix9p3i%2BvbdGhQpxk4HzpYMoqXal2lBW1GCdCX4A%3D) ensure you get correct quantities, eg 4x wheels and motors. 

If you don't get JLPCB to fabricate the PCB you'll also need some 2.54mm screw terminals or a breadboard [For connecting encoder](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001677869988.html)

Note a previous iteration of this project used the Pi Pico dimensions, if you wanted that the [PCB is here](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=69415ef7785b4ad29ea97032be2ffa39)

## Microblocks Software - Best if you're just starting

Current status: Working but you have to build in Platformio to get ESP32-S3 support

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosmo-robot/rosmo-robot.github.io/master/assets/img/microblocks.png)

- Provides a block programing interface 

- Provides an [Android app](http://www.microblocks.fun/wifigamepad/gamepadwifiremote.apk)  for remote control & [detailed instructions](http://www.microblocks.fun/en/wifi/gamepad)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosmo-robot/rosmo-robot.github.io/master/assets/img/wsgamepad-start.jpg)

Use the [Pilot version](https://microblocks.fun/download) from the bottom of the downloads page. Then to quickly get started download this raw [UBP file](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/rosmo-robot.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/ziopublicwifiremote.ubp) and open it in the Microblocks app.

## Ros2 - Best if you want to learn ROS2

Current status: I2C comms with Zio driver established and wheel spinning, but not working fully yet 
  
- [Linorobot2](https://github.com/hippo5329/linorobot2_hardware/tree/esp32_zio) Zio driver now supported.
- [Virtual machine for download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1itU1ZYsxZf3GO9LMmP3NauBo0db6XsqN/view?usp=sharing) Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS2/Linorobot. For use with [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
- On a Linux host; sudo adduser $YOUR-USER vboxusers then follow [this guide](https://roboticsbackend.com/control-arduino-from-ubuntu-virtualbox/) reboot your computer
- nano /linorobot2_hardware/config/custom put in your wifi credentials near the bottom of the file, set the agent IP to the address of your computer
- cd /linorobot2_hardware/firmware
- pio run -e esp32_zio -t upload
-  ros2 launch linorobot2_bringup bringup.launch.py micro_ros_transport:=udp4 micro_ros_port:=8888

## Micropython
Doesn't exist yet, might be interesting to do something with [ESP32_Car_Platform](https://github.com/jppang/ESP32_Car_Platform/tree/main/software) & [Motor driver code](https://github.com/ZIOCC/Qwiic_4-Ch_DC_Motor_Controller/tree/master/micropython) at some point

## Arduino 
Doesn't exist yet, might be interesting to do something with [Smartcar Shield](https://github.com/platisd/smartcar_shield?tab=readme-ov-file#software) at some point
